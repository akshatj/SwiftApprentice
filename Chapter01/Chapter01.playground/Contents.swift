Declare a constant Int called myAge and set it equal to your age. Also declare an Int variable called dogs and set it equal to the number of dogs you own. Then imagine you bought a new puppy and increment the dogs variable by one.
*/

 Given the following code:

 print(age)
 Modify the first line so that it compiles. Did you use var or let?

 // 1
 let answer1: Int = (x * 100) + y

/* Challenge 6: Electrical power
 The power of an electrical appliance can be calculated by multiplying the voltage by the current. Declare a constant named voltage of type Double and assign it a value. Then declare a constant called current of type Double and assign it a value. Finally calculate the power of the electrical appliance you‚Äôve just created storing it in a constant called power of type Double.

let resistance: Double = power / (current * current)

/* Challenge 8: Random integer
 You can create a random integer number by using the function arc4random(). This creates a number anywhere between 0 and 4294967295. You can use the modulo operator to truncate this random number to whatever range you want. Declare a constant randomNumber and assign it a random number generated with arc4random(). Then calculate a constant called diceRoll and use the random number you just found to create a random number between 1 and 6.

/* Challenge 9: Quadratic equations
 A quadratic equation is something of the form a‚ãÖx¬≤ + b‚ãÖx + c = 0. The values of x which satisfy this can be solved by using the equation x = (-b ¬± sqrt(b¬≤ - 4‚ãÖa‚ãÖc)) / (2‚ãÖa). Declare three constants named a, b and c of type Double. Then calculate the two values for x using the equation above (noting that the ¬± means plus or minus ‚Äî so one value of x for each). Store the results in constants called root1 and root2 of type Double.
